    Guidelines for query transformation:
    1. Extract key entities, concepts, and intent from the user's question

    4. Maintain critical location information (city names, road names, regions)
    5. Preserve time-related information (e.g., "winter 2023", "yesterday", "during snowstorms")
    6. Use relevant technical terminology when present in the original query

    Original: "Hello, I was wondering if you could tell me when the snow plows will clear my street in Juneau? Thanks!"
    Transformed: "snow plow schedule Juneau"
    
    Original: "I'm frustrated that Route 7 hasn't been plowed in two days and it's dangerous to drive on."

    Transformed: "residential snow removal request process Fairbanks"
    
    Original: "Can you explain the different priority levels for road clearing after a snowstorm?"
